These scrips provide reproducibility of research results that aimed to understand whether ground-reference rice trait data could be predicted from hyperspectral imaging data. Please download data deposited at [ https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/4079/1 ] and update the directory in the "import data" chunk accordingly to run the code. Pipelines for each scrip are generally the same with functions appearing first. The propose for making a bundle of scrips is to generate unique pdf file for the trait consider or for the hyperparameter of interest. The file names are explained below:
